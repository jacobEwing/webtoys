ideas

- change the confirmation of saved rendering deletions to a proper windowy div, and add a "Don't ask again" checkbox.
- Add a colour shift option that simply offsets the count when calculating
  colour.  This should allow better palette cycling when using different wave
  frequencies.
- a way to save/reload the palette
- add a y-offset and amplitude to the colour waves
- add a plotter showing the colour waves
- integrate multiple palette control methods
- add an indicator when a render is happening.
