ideas
- add a "stagger pattern" option, where you can select between different types of staggering (e.g. checker, dotted, etc.)
- add image mapping, taking the end (c, ci) and mapping it to a pixel on a source image.
- add a "working" indicator when rendering takes more than a small amount of time.
- change the confirmation of saved rendering deletions to a proper windowy div, and add a "Don't ask again" checkbox.
- Add a colour shift option that simply offsets the count when calculating
  colour.  This should allow better palette cycling when using different wave
  frequencies.
- a way to save/reload the palette
- add a y-offset and amplitude to the colour waves
- add a plotter showing the colour waves
- integrate multiple palette control methods
- add a better help/intro system
