ideas

- add UI components to toggle rendeing options that I currently enable by modifying the code
- have a way of pausing the rendering of saved settings when rendering in the main display
- give staggering a period cycle allowing it to vary with RGB
- a reset button for the palette
- a way to save/reload the palette
- add a "don't show this again" to the welcome prompt.
